# MiniRT
A basic raytracer made as a student project at 42 SÃ£o Paulo.

# Work History

August 14th 2020 - Started building the basic functions and structures to open a file, parse its content and process the information accordingly.

August 17th 2020 - Cleaned up the Makefile a little bit, so that .o files will go on their own folder and it keeps Libft as it's own submodule so it can be updated/modified easily.

# WARNING

loops_test.c is VERY BROKEN and does not play nicely with graphics drivers. Run at your own risk.
