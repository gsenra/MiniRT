# Work History

August 14th 2020 - Started building the basic functions and structures to open a file, parse its content and process the information accordingly.

August 17th 2020 - Cleaned up the Makefile a little bit, so that .o files will go on their own folder and it keeps Libft as it's own submodule so it can be updated/modified easily. Doing some more work on the file parsing structure, and managed to get information from a file and put it on a struct to use later, plus some very basic error returns for invalid file structures.

August 18th 2020 - Integrated file parsing functions with MiniLibX functions to use information contained on a file to set the resolution of an output window.
